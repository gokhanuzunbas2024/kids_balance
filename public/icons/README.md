# PWA Icons

Place your PWA icons in this directory:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels
- `icon-180x180.png` - 180x180 pixels (for iOS)

You can generate these icons from a single source image using tools like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares with the app name/logo.
